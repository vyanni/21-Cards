# PCC-Program-Submission - Unity 21 (Vianney Susanto)
---
## Introduction
The game is my submission of the 21-card game for PointClickCare's Early Tech Talent Incubator Program. 
21 Cards was made using the Unity game engine, written in C#. 

# Game Rules
It's a single-player game, where the player competes with the AI dealer.

Players attempt to collect as many points as they can to have a bigger hand than the dealer without going over 21.
You can hit or stay with the buttons aside, or with some keyboard input. 

## Game Set-Up
In the **"Build"** folder, there'll be both the regular folder as well as the zipped folder to download and install. 

If downloading the zipped folder, you must extract it first before going into the new extracted folder and opening the file "21cards.exe", which opens the game.
